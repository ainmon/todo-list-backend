# Todo List

## Requirements

- You will need to have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) installed on your machine

## Introduction

This a full-stack application using Javascript and React as our frontend and Ruby's ActiveRecord for the backend! It will allow you to keep track and edit your todo's in realtime!

### Backend Setup

To get started, make sure you are in the correct directory that you cloned the backend to.
Once there, you can go ahead and run the following command.

```console
$ bundle exec rake server
```

This will run your server on port
[http://localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292).

### Frontend Setup

To fork the repo for the frontend, you can go [here](https://github.com/ainmon/todo-list)

Once you have cloned the frontend, make sure you're in the correct directory and run the following command.

```console
$ npm start
```

With your backend listening, you should see a ready-to-go todo list! It will be available to handle all of your needs right away. Enjoy!
